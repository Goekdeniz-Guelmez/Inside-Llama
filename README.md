# Inside Llama

Welcome to "Inside Llama," a repository that doesn't just peel back the layers of Meta's Llama 3 model—it tears them apart, piece by piece, until every secret is laid bare. This notebook isn't for the faint of heart. It’s for those who know that the path to power is paved with knowledge and meticulous attention to detail. We're going to take you step by step through the creation and training of your own Llama 3 model, using a character-based tokenizer inspired by Andrew Karpathy's GPT-2 lecture. Of course, if you prefer, you can switch to the original tokenizer from the Huggingface Hub with the `transformers` library. Flexibility is power, after all.

## Getting Started

The first step on this journey is to clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Some of these may need to be installed via `pip`. Consider this your first hurdle.

### Installation

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

## Notebook Overview

This notebook is divided into several critical sections. Each one is a rung on the ladder to dominance over the machine learning landscape.

### 1. Frameworks and Libraries

We start with the essential libraries and functions. These are your tools, your weapons in the fight to understand and create.

```python
from typing import Optional, Tuple
import math
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch import nn
import torch
from plot import createPlot, createLossPlot, LlamaVisualizer
```

### 2. Model Parameters

Here, we define the parameters for our model. Dimensions, layers, heads—these are the building blocks of your empire.

```python
dim: int = 16
n_layers: int = 6
n_heads: int = 8
n_kv_heads: Optional[int] = 8
vocab_size: int = -1
multiple_of: int = 24
ffn_dim_multiplier: Optional[float] = None
rms_norm_eps: float = 1e-5
max_batch_size: int = 6
max_seq_len: int = 32
plot = False
```

### 3. Model Building and Training

This section is the heart of our endeavor, where the abstract becomes tangible. We guide you through the meticulous process of building and training the Llama 3 model. The tokenizer is set up, the model architecture is defined, and training is conducted on a dataset, each step a precise cut in the creation of a masterpiece.

### 4. Visualization

A true artist appreciates their work from every angle. Our notebook includes tools for visualization, allowing you to peer into the depths of the model's performance and internal mechanics. These visual aids can be enabled with the `plot` parameter, turning raw data into an elegant display of progress and proficiency.

## Customization

True artistry lies in personal touch. You are invited to customize various aspects of the model, from the tokenizer to the very parameters that define its behavior. Tailor these elements to your specific needs, and let your creation sing with its unique voice.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from those who share our passion for excellence. If you possess ideas, suggestions, or encounter any issues, we implore you to submit a pull request or open an issue on GitHub. Collaboration is the path to perfection.
